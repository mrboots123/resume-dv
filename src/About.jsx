                <p className='text-md text-wrap'>Senior Software Engineer with 9 years of experience designing and delivering end-to-end software solutions across both financial and geospatial domains. At American Express, I contributed to high-impact financial applications, and more recently Iâ€™ve built GIS platforms using React, wireframes, and a full-stack approach. I excel at translating requirements into intuitive user interfaces and scalable backend services, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to drive projects from concept through production. Passionate about continuous improvement, I focus on architecting maintainable, high-performance code that meets business goals.</p>
